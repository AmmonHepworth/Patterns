I decided to go with a compositional Adapter Pattern. I chose this over the Bridge pattern because I didn't feel like the RefinedAbstraction had a good role here. I am not really extending any of the interface, it's just a 1 to 1 mapping mostly. The Adapter pattern fit much better because there is a defined Target in the W3C interface and a defined Adaptee in our interfaces and they just needed an Adapter. We're also not necessarily trying to decouple the implementation from an abstraction, we have 2 different things that already exist and we need to make them work together. I think that fits the Adapter Pattern much better.
